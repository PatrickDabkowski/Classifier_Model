# Classifier_Model

In the current project, I used open source Machine Learning libraries to build, train and compare two digit classifiers, Naive Bayes Classifier and Convolutional Neural Network. Digits are numbers from 0 to 9 accessible in MNIST dataset from the TensorFlow module. Test images are generated with NumPy and Scikit-Image modules. 

The task is done by object-oriented programming with separated modules for loading data set, training/loading models and tests.

I am looking forward to implement real time classifiere connected with the webcamera
